	<h3>What is a Mango ?</h3>
	<p>A mango is an edible stone fruit produced by the tropical tree Mangifera indica. It is believed to have originated between northwestern Myanmar, Bangladesh, and northeastern India.[1] M. indica has been cultivated in South and Southeast Asia since ancient times resulting in two types of modern mango cultivars: the "Indian type" and the "Southeast Asian type".[2][3] Other species in the genus Mangifera also produce edible fruits that are also called "mangoes", the majority of which are found in the Malesian ecoregion.
Worldwide, there are several hundred cultivars of mango. Depending on the cultivar, mango fruit varies in size, shape, sweetness, skin color, and flesh color, which may be pale yellow, gold, green, or orange.[1] Mango is the national fruit of India, Pakistan and the Philippines,[5][6] while the mango tree is the national tree of Bangladesh.</p><br>

<h3>Describe a Mango and its tree?</h3>
<p>Mango trees grow to 30–40 metres (98–131 feet) tall, with a crown radius of 10–15 m (33–49 ft). The trees are long-lived, as some specimens still fruit after 300 years.<br>

In deep soil, the taproot descends to a depth of 6 m (20 ft), with profuse, wide-spreading feeder roots and anchor roots penetrating deeply into the soil.[1] The leaves are evergreen, alternate, simple, 15–35 centimetres (6–14 inches) long, and 6–16 cm (2+1⁄2–6+1⁄2 in) broad; when the leaves are young they are orange-pink, rapidly changing to a dark, glossy red, then dark green as they mature.[1] The flowers are produced in terminal panicles 10–40 cm (4–15+1⁄2 in) long; each flower is small and white with five petals 5–10 millimetres (3⁄16–3⁄8 in) long, with a mild, sweet fragrance.[1] Over 500 varieties of mangoes are known,[1] many of which ripen in summer, while some give a double crop.[11] The fruit takes four to five months from flowering to ripening.

The ripe fruit varies according to cultivar in size, shape, color, sweetness, and eating quality.[1] Depending on the cultivar, fruits are variously yellow, orange, red, or green.[1] The fruit has a single flat, oblong pit that can be fibrous or hairy on the surface and does not separate easily from the pulp.[1] The fruits may be somewhat round, oval, or kidney-shaped, ranging from 5–25 centimetres (2–10 in) in length and from 140 grams (5 oz) to 2 kilograms (5 lb) in weight per individual fruit.[1] The skin is leather-like, waxy, smooth, and fragrant, with colors ranging from green to yellow, yellow-orange, yellow-red, or blushed with various shades of red, purple, pink, or yellow when fully ripe.</p><br>

<h3>What is Etymology of Mango?</h3>
<p>The English word mango (plural "mangoes" or "mangos") originated in the 16th century from the Portuguese word, manga, from the Malay mangga, and ultimately from the Tamil man ("mango tree") + kay ("fruit").[8][9] The scientific name, Mangifera indica, refers to a plant bearing mangoes in India.</p><br>

<h3>What Nutritions are in Mangoes?</h3>
<p>A raw mango is 84% water, 15% carbohydrates, 1% protein, and has negligible fat (table). The energy value per 100 g (3.5 oz) serving of raw mango is 250 kJ (60 calories). Fresh mango contains only vitamin C and folate in significant amounts of the Daily Value as 44% and 11%, respectively.</p>

<h3>What is cultural significance of Mangoes?</h3>
	<p>The mango is the national fruit of India.[71][72] It is also the national tree of Bangladesh.[73][74] In India, harvest and sale of mangoes is during March–May and this is annually covered by news agencies.<br>

The mango has a traditional context in the culture of South Asia. In his edicts, the Mauryan emperor Ashoka references the planting of fruit- and shade-bearing trees along imperial roads:<br>

"On the roads banyan-trees were caused to be planted by me, (in order that) they might afford shade to cattle and men, (and) mango-groves were caused to be planted."<br>

In medieval India, the Indo-Persian poet Amir Khusrow termed the mango "Naghza Tarin Mewa Hindustan" – "the fairest fruit of Hindustan." Mangoes were enjoyed at the court of the Delhi Sultan Alauddin Khijli. The Mughal Empire was especially fond of the fruits: Babur praises the mango in his Babarnameh. At the same time, Sher Shah Suri inaugurated the creation of the Chaunsa variety after his victory over the Mughal emperor Humayun. Mughal patronage of horticulture led to the grafting of thousands of mangoes varieties, including the famous Totapuri, which was the first variety to be exported to Iran and Central Asia.[citation needed] Akbar (1556–1605) is said to have planted a mango orchard of 100,000 trees near Darbhanga, Bihar,[75] while Jahangir and Shah Jahan ordered the planting of mango orchards in Lahore and Delhi and the creation of mango-based desserts.</p><br>

<h3>What Flavours are in Mangoes?</h3>
<p>The flavor of mango fruits is conferred by several volatile organic chemicals mainly belonging to terpene, furanone, lactone, and ester classes. Different varieties or cultivars of mangoes can have flavors made up of different volatile chemicals or the same volatile chemicals in different quantities.[54] In general, New World mango cultivars are characterized by the dominance of δ-3-carene, a monoterpene flavorant; whereas, high concentration of other monoterpenes such as (Z)-ocimene and myrcene, as well as the presence of lactones and furanones, is the unique feature of Old World cultivars.[55][56][57] In India, 'Alphonso' is one of the most popular cultivars. In 'Alphonso' mango, the lactones and furanones are synthesized during ripening, whereas terpenes and the other flavorants are present in both the developing (immature) and ripening fruits.[58][59][60] Ethylene, a ripening-related hormone well known to be involved in ripening of mango fruits, causes changes in the flavor composition of mango fruits upon exogenous application, as well.[61][62] In contrast to the huge amount of information available on the chemical composition of mango flavor, the biosynthesis of these chemicals has not been studied in depth; only a handful of genes encoding the enzymes of flavor biosynthetic pathways have been characterized to date.</p><br>

<h3>Are there any Toxicity in Mangoes ?</h3>
<p>Contact with oils in mango leaves, stems, sap, and skin can cause dermatitis and anaphylaxis in susceptible individuals.[1][37][67] Those with a history of contact dermatitis induced by urushiol (an allergen found in poison ivy, poison oak, or poison sumac) may be most at risk for mango contact dermatitis.[68] Other mango compounds potentially responsible for dermatitis or allergic reactions include mangiferin.[1] Cross-reactions may occur between mango allergens and urushiol.[69] Sensitized individuals may not be able to eat peeled mangos or drink mango juice safely</p><br>

<h3>Chemistry of Mango?</h3>
<p>Numerous phytochemicals are present in mango peel and pulp, such as the triterpene lupeol.[45] Mango peel pigments under study include carotenoids, such as the provitamin A compound, beta-carotene, lutein and alpha-carotene,[46][47] and polyphenols, such as quercetin, kaempferol, gallic acid, caffeic acid, catechins and tannins.[48][49] Mango contains a unique xanthonoid called mangiferin.[50]<br>

Phytochemical and nutrient content appears to vary across mango cultivars.[51] Up to 25 different carotenoids have been isolated from mango pulp, the densest of which was beta-carotene, which accounts for the yellow-orange pigmentation of most mango cultivars.[52] Mango leaves also have significant polyphenol content, including xanthonoids, mangiferin and gallic acid.</p><br>

<h3>Where are Mango produced the most?</h3>
<p>In 2020, world production of mangoes (report includes mangosteens and guavas) was 55 million tonnes, led by India with 45% of the total (table).[25] Almost half of the world's mangoes are cultivated in India alone, with the second-largest source being Indonesia.[29][30][31] Although India is the largest producer of mangoes, it accounts for less than 1% of the international mango trade; India consumes most of its own production.

Other major mango-producing countries in total tonnage produced in 2020 were Indonesia, China, Pakistan, Mexico, Brazil, Bangladesh, Nigeria, and the Philippines (table).

At the wholesale level, the price of mangoes varies according to size, variety, and other factors. The FOB Price reported by the United States Department of Agriculture for all mangoes imported into the US ranged from approximately US$4.60 (average low price) to $5.74 (average high price) per box (4 kg/box) during 2018.</p><br>

<h3>Uses of Mangoes?</h3>
<p>Mangoes are generally sweet, although the taste and texture of the flesh vary across cultivars; some, such as Alphonso, have a soft, pulpy, juicy texture similar to an overripe plum, while others, such as Tommy Atkins, are firmer, like a cantaloupe or avocado, with a fibrous texture.[36]

The skin of unripe, pickled, or cooked mango can be eaten, but it has the potential to cause contact dermatitis of the lips, gingiva, or tongue in susceptible people.<br>
Mangoes are used in many cuisines. Sour, unripe mangoes are used in chutneys (i.e. Mango chutney), pickles, daals and other side dishes in Bengali cuisine. A summer drink called aam panna is made with mangoes. Mango pulp made into jelly or cooked with red gram dhal and green chilies may be served with cooked rice. Mango lassi is popular throughout South Asia,[38] prepared by mixing ripe mangoes or mango pulp with buttermilk and sugar. Ripe mangoes are also used to make curries. Aamras is a popular thick juice made of mangoes with sugar or milk and is consumed with chapatis or pooris. The pulp from ripe mangoes is also used to make jam called mangada. Andhra aavakaaya is a pickle made from raw, unripe, pulpy, and sour mango mixed with chili powder, fenugreek seeds, mustard powder, salt, and groundnut oil. Mango is also used in Andhra Pradesh to make dahl preparations. Gujarat uses mango to make chunda (a sweet and spicy, grated mango delicacy).</p><br>
